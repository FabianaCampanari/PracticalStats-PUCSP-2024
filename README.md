## **Statistics and Probability**
 
This repository, created by [Fabiana ðŸš€ Campanari](https://linktr.ee/fabianacampanari) in the 2nd semester of 2024, consolidates the materials and code developed for the Statistics and Probability course within the Data Science and Artificial Intelligence program at PUC-SP, under the guidance of [Professor Eric Bacconi GonÃ§alves](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eric-bacconi-423137/)
). It is designed to support hands-on learning through exercises, scripts, and datasets.

## Repository Contents:

<br>

- **Python Scripts**: This section includes scripts for a wide range of statistical analyses, covering key topics such as distributions, population and sample concepts, and hypothesis testing. Calculations include:
  - **Central Tendency**: Mean, median, and mode
  - **Dispersion**: Standard deviation, variance, and range
  - **Positional Measures**: Percentiles and quartiles (Q1, Q2, Q3)
  - **Distribution Shape**: Skewness and kurtosis
  - **Confidence Intervals** for estimating population parameters
  - **Correlation and Covariance** for bivariate analysis
 
 <br>   

- **Practical Exercises**: Available in Python and Excel, these exercises provide hands-on practice in calculating statistical measures and applying concepts, including:
  - **Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)**: Comparing means across multiple groups
  - **Hypothesis Testing**: Null hypothesis (\( H_0 \)) tests, such as T-tests (one-sample, independent, and paired), ANOVA, and Chi-square tests
  - **Regression Analysis**: Linear regression models for predictive analysis
  - **Probability**: Exercises covering probability distributions, expected value, and variance
 
 <br>   

- **Statistical Tests**: This section includes implementations of statistical tests tailored to analyze variables like age and salary, categorized by region and educational level. Each test includes the process of setting up and testing the null hypothesis (\( H_0 \)) for statistical significance.

<br>  

- **Support Materials**: Supplementary documentation on probability, relevant datasets, and homework assignments to reinforce key concepts.

<br>

## Study Topics:

This repository provides a comprehensive foundation in core topics, including Descriptive Statistics, Probability Distributions, Population and Sample, Hypothesis Testing I and II (featuring null hypothesis (\( H_0 \)) testing), and Regression Analysis. It serves as a practical tool for building statistical and analytical skills.


## Statistical Measures Analysis in Python

This  contains Python scripts for conducting descriptive statistical analysis on employee salary and age data, both for the entire dataset and grouped by education level and region of origin.


## Features:

Descriptive statistics: Mean, Median, Mode, Variance, Standard Deviation, Coefficient of Variation (CV), and Amplitude (Range).
Grouped analysis: The same statistics calculated by grouping data based on region and education level.
Designed for students: Easy-to-follow code with comments and explanations for each step.

<br>

## Dataset:

The dataset used in this analysis contains employee details, including their age, salary, region of origin (reg_proc), and education level (grau_instrucao).
[Click here to get the Dataset](https://github.com/FabianaCampanari/statisticalMeasures-python-/tree/a9e92b1cbce36fa5f26edeadef937981012f0a98/Dataset)

<br>

## Getting Started:

### To run this script, ensure you have the following:

- Python 3 installed.

- Necessary libraries (pandas) installed.

- An Excel file containing the dataset in the appropriate format.
