## **Statistics and Probability**
 
This repository, created by [Fabiana ðŸš€ Campanari](https://linktr.ee/fabianacampanari) in the 2nd semester of 2024, consolidates the materials and code developed for the Statistics and Probability course within the Data Science and Artificial Intelligence program at PUC-SP, under the guidance of [Professor Eric Bacconi GonÃ§alves](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eric-bacconi-423137/). It is designed to support hands-on learning through exercises, scripts, and datasets.

## Repository Contents:

<br>

- **Python Scripts**: This section includes scripts for a wide range of statistical analyses, covering key topics such as distributions, population and sample concepts, and hypothesis testing. Calculations include:
  - **Central Tendency**: Mean, median, and mode
  - **Dispersion**: Standard deviation, variance, and range
  - **Positional Measures**: Percentiles and quartiles (Q1, Q2, Q3)
  - **Distribution Shape**: Skewness and kurtosis
  - **Confidence Intervals** for estimating population parameters
  - **Correlation and Covariance** for bivariate analysis
 
 <br>   

- **Practical Exercises**: Available in Python and Excel, these exercises provide hands-on practice in calculating statistical measures and applying concepts, including:
  - **Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)**: Comparing means across multiple groups
  - **Hypothesis Testing**: Null hypothesis (\( H_0 \)) tests, such as T-tests (one-sample, independent, and paired), ANOVA, and Chi-square tests
  - **Regression Analysis**: Linear regression models for predictive analysis
  - **Probability**: Exercises covering probability distributions, expected value, and variance
 
 <br>   

- **Statistical Tests**: This section includes implementations of statistical tests tailored to analyze variables like age and salary, categorized by region and educational level. Each test includes the process of setting up and testing the null hypothesis (\( H_0 \)) for statistical significance.

<br>  

- **Support Materials**: Supplementary documentation on probability, relevant datasets, and homework assignments to reinforce key concepts.

### 3. One-Sample t-Test

```python
Copy code

# Exercise 3 â€“ Test the hypothesis that the salary is equal to 12. What is your conclusion?
# Import pandas library
import pandas as pd

# Import scipy library
import scipy.stats as stats

# File path
file_path = 'add_your_dataset_path_here'

# Load the file into Python
df = pd.read_excel(file_path)
print(df.head())

# Bring only the age variable to perform the test
base_age = df['idade']

# Execute the t-test testing H0: age = 32 and H1: age â‰  32
result_t_test = stats.ttest_1samp(base_age, 32)
p_value = result_t_test.pvalue
alpha = 0.05

if p_value < alpha:
    print("We reject the null hypothesis (H0).")
else:
    print("We do not reject the null hypothesis (H0).")

# Remember the mean
print(f"Mean age: {df.idade.mean()}")

# Execute the t-test testing H0: age = 34 and H1: age â‰  34
result_t_test = stats.ttest_1samp(base_age, 34)
p_value = result_t_test.pvalue
alpha = 0.05

# Decision based on p-value
if p_value < alpha:
    print("We reject the null hypothesis (H0).")
else:
    print("We do not reject the null hypothesis (H0).")

# With a p-value of 0.045, which is less than the significance level of 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis. This indicates that there is statistically significant evidence to suggest that the average age of employees is different from 34.

# Execute the t-test testing H0: age = 35 and H1: age â‰  35
result_t_test = stats.ttest_1samp(base_age, 35)
p_value = result_t_test.pvalue
alpha = 0.05

# Decision based on p-value
if p_value < alpha:
    print("We reject the null hypothesis (H0).")
else:
    print("We do not reject the null hypothesis (H0).")

# With a p-value of 0.2234, which is greater than the significance level of 0.05, we do not reject the null hypothesis. This means that there is not enough evidence to conclude that the average age of employees is different from the hypothesized value (32, 35, or any other value being tested).

# Answering question 3

# Test the hypothesis that the salary is equal to 12. What is your conclusion?
import pandas as pd
import scipy.stats as stats

# File path
file_path = 'add_your_dataset_path_here'

# Load the data
df = pd.read_excel(file_path)
print(df.head())

# Select the variable of interest (salary)
salaries = df['salario']

# Execute the t-test testing H0: salary = 12 and H1: salary â‰  12
result_t_test = stats.ttest_1samp(salaries, 12)
print(result_t_test)

# Get the p-value from the test result
p_value = result_t_test.pvalue

# Define the significance level
alpha = 0.05

# Interpret the result
p_value = 8.755117588192511e-06

if p_value < alpha:
    print("We reject the null hypothesis (H0).")
else:
    print("We do not reject the null hypothesis (H0).")

# Define the conclusion based on the p-value and the significance level
if p_value < alpha:
    conclusion = "We reject the null hypothesis (H0)."
else:
    conclusion = "We do not reject the null hypothesis (H0)."

# Display the test result and conclusion
print(f"t-test statistic: {result_t_test.statistic}")
print(f"p-value: {result_t_test.pvalue}")
print(conclusion)

# Analysis and Conclusion with p-value and significance level

# In the hypothesis test performed, we tested the null hypothesis (H0) that the average salary of employees is equal to 12 against the alternative hypothesis (H1) that the average salary of employees is different from 12.

# The results of the t-test were as follows:
# - t-test statistic: -4.500727991746298
# - p-value: 8.755117588192511e-06

# With a p-value of approximately 8.76e-06, which is significantly less than the significance level of 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis (H0). This indicates that there is statistically significant evidence to suggest that the average salary of employees is different from 12.

# Therefore, the conclusion of the test is that we reject the null hypothesis (H0) and accept the alternative hypothesis (H1), indicating that the average salary of employees is not equal to 12.

### 4. Two-Sample t-Test

```python

copy code

### Question 4

#### To test the hypothesis that income is equal for the two marital statuses (single and married), we can use the t-test for independent samples. We will follow these steps:
### Visualization

#### 1. Extract income data for singles and married individuals.
#### 2. Perform the t-test for independent samples.
#### 3. Interpret the p-value to accept or reject the null hypothesis.

### Steps in pseudocode:

1. **Import necessary libraries** (pandas and scipy.stats).
2. **Load data from the Excel file**.
3. **Extract income columns for singles and married individuals**.
4. **Perform the t-test for independent samples**.
5. **Interpret the result based on the p-value**.

# Install scipy if necessary
# %pip install scipy pandas
import pandas as pd
from scipy import stats

# Load the data from the Excel file
file_path = 'add_your_dataset_path_here'
df = pd.read_excel(file_path)

# Visualize the first rows of the DataFrame
print(df.head())

# Check the mean salary by marital status group
print(df.groupby(['estado_civil'])['salario'].describe())

# Extract income columns for singles and married individuals
single_income = df[df['estado_civil'] == 's']['salario']
married_income = df[df['estado_civil'] == 'c']['salario']

# Perform the t-test for independent samples
t_stat, p_value = stats.ttest_ind(married_income, single_income, equal_var=False)

# Display the results of the t-test
print("Results of the t-Test:")
print(f"t-statistic: {t_stat}")
print(f"p-value: {p_value}")

# Interpret the result
alpha = 0.05
if p_value < alpha:
    print("Conclusion: We reject the null hypothesis. The incomes are different for the two marital statuses.")
else:
    print("Conclusion: We do not reject the null hypothesis. The incomes are equal for the two marital statuses.")

### Conclusion Results of the t-Test:

#### Interpretation:
 - t-statistic: 4.567472731259726 <br>
 - p-value: 6.527014259249644e-06

The p-value is extremely small (6.527014259249644e-06), much smaller than the common significance level (0.05). This indicates that there is a significant difference in income between the two marital statuses.

**Conclusion:**

We reject the null hypothesis. The incomes are different for the two marital statuses (single and married).
```
